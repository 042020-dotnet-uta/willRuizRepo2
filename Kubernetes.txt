1.  Loads containers into clusters.  Plans how to get containers to the right clusters.
Identifies the right cluster, stores informatoin about the clusters and nodes.
Manages the Kubernetes cluster and does all of the above

a.  Control Plane Components
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Kuberlet

2.  Its a DB that stores info about all nodes and clusters in K:V

a.  ETCD Cluster
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Kuberlet

3.  Identifies the right node to put a container on based on requirements.  
It watches for new pods, clusters and depending on the requirements of the 
application container and figures out the node that is best for that container

a.  kube-scheduler
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Kuberlet

4.  Primary management components of Kubernetes.  It orchestrates all operations w/i a 
cluster.  Exposes the Kubernetes API (used by external users to do mgt opererations on the
on the cluster + controllers to monitor state + make changes as needed).  It also fetches 
status reports from the Kublet to monitor the status of the nodes + containers
within the cluster

a.  kube-apiserver
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Kuberlet

5.  Makes sure the required number of containers are running at all times  

a.  Replication controller
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Kuberlet

6.  Its the agent + component of teh node that runs on each node in a cluster.  It listens for 
instructions from kube-apiserver and deploys/destroys containers on the nodes as required. It
communicates with the master-node.  Gathers info about teh containers to be loaded in that cluster
and reports status to teh master node about the status of teh cluster and the containers

a.  Kubelet
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Kube-proxy

7.  Apps running on nodes need a way to communicate with each other.  This is a node component that runs
on each and every node that, helps nodes communicate with each other.  This runs on a worker node and
has the rules of how containers + nodes can communicate with each other

a.  Kube-proxy
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Container run-time-engine

8.  This is used to host your apps in the form of containers in an automated way.  It allows you
to easily deploy as many instances of your app as needed  + easily communicate between services

a.  Kubernetes
b.  Worker nodes
c.  Kube-ApiServer
d.  Container run-time-engine
